'Microwave image simulation is an important tool in gaining\n   understanding in microwave imaging with air- or spaceborne sensors.\n   The package FEMIS was developed for this purpose in 1991. Its use was\n   limited due to software limitations (FORTRAN) and its being dependent\n   on a VAX computer and the IVAS image processing system. A new project\n   was proposed to upgrade FEMIS to: run on a PC, provide a user friendly\n   interface, provide links to a microwave backscatter data base, and a\n   Geographical Information System (GIS).\n\n   The new package that has now been developed is called CERISE. It is\n   programmed in C, runs on a PC in a window environment, and is able to\n   use data from a backscatter data base and a GIS (ARC-INFO) in a\n   semi-automatic manner. A start has been made with the inclusion of\n   radar image artefacts caused by varying terrain or object height and\n   the use of data from a DEM (Digital elevation model). Since the\n   project has stirred interest in the area of Defense, modifications\n   such as full DEM utilization and simulation of man-made objects are\n   being planned for the near future.\n\n   J.C.M.
